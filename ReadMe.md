This application will allow the user to store a list of his/her favorite GIF topics and recall 10 GIFs at a time on command. The user can add a new item to the list (which is stored in local memory) by entering it in the search field which will create a button representing the search term. The button, when clicked, will recall 10 GIFs in the theme of the button's search term. The 'clear last' button will remove the last button to have been clicked. If all buttons have been removed then the default list will repopulate.
